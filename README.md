This project presents a comparative analysis of supply chain management (SCM) practices across three major economies — the United States, Japan, and Germany. The study covers:
- Vertical Integration strategies and industry-specific practices.
- Horizontal Integration, including Just-In-Time (JIT) and Lean Manufacturing.
- Digitized Manufacturing and Industry 4.0 innovations.
- Sustainability and environmentally benign manufacturing practices.
- Cultural influences on SCM decision-making.
The analysis is supported by real-world case studies, including Toyota’s post-disaster supply chain resilience measures, and explores how different economic, cultural, and regulatory contexts shape supply chain strategies.
